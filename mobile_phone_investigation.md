# Mobile POS System Production Readiness Investigation

## Executive Summary

This investigation analyzes the **Fynlo POS** mobile payment system to identify critical production readiness issues. The system consists of a React Native mobile app and FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL database, designed for restaurant/retail point-of-sale operations.

**Overall Assessment: üö® NOT PRODUCTION READY**

While the system claims to be "83% production ready," this investigation reveals multiple critical security, performance, and infrastructure issues that must be addressed before production deployment.
