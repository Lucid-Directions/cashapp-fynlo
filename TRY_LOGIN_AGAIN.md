# Try Login Again - Fixed Backend URL! ✅

I've fixed the backend URL issue. The app was trying to use the wrong backend URL.

## What Was Fixed:
- ✅ Changed backend URL from `https://fynlopos-9eg2c.ondigitalocean.app` to `https://api.fynlo.co.uk`
- ✅ The backend at `https://api.fynlo.co.uk` is confirmed working

## Try Login Now:

1. **The app should still be running** (if not, run it again from Xcode)

2. **On the login screen**:
   - Email: `sleepyarno@gmail.com`
   - Password: Your Supabase password
   - Tap "Sign In"

## If Login Still Fails:

The test showed "Invalid login credentials" which means either:
1. The password is incorrect
2. The user might need to be recreated

### Option 1: Reset Your Password in Supabase
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/eweggzpvuqczrrrwszyy/auth/users
2. Find your user (sleepyarno@gmail.com)
3. Click the three dots menu → "Send password reset"
4. Check your email and reset password

### Option 2: Create a New Test User
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Click "Add user" → "Create new user"
3. Use a new email or delete and recreate sleepyarno@gmail.com
4. Set a password you'll remember
5. Check "Auto Confirm Email"

## Important Notes:

- The backend IS running at https://api.fynlo.co.uk ✅
- The backend IS configured to recognize you as platform owner ✅
- Just need the correct Supabase credentials ✅

Once you can log in, the backend will:
1. Verify your Supabase token
2. Check if email = PLATFORM_OWNER_EMAIL
3. Create/update your user as platform_owner
4. Return your user info to the app

Try logging in again with the correct password!
