# Fix Database Column Migration - Resolve Authentication Failures

## 🎯 Purpose

This PR provides a comprehensive database migration tool to fix the critical authentication failures in the Fynlo POS system. Users are unable to sign in because SQLAlchemy is querying for columns that don't exist in the production database.

## 🔧 Problem

The authentication system is failing with:
```
column restaurants.floor_plan_layout does not exist
```

Even after removing `floor_plan_layout` from the model (PR #305), SQLAlchemy's cached metadata continues to query for it. Additionally, the subscription fields are missing but required for the app to function.

## 🛠️ Solution

Created a robust database migration tool that:
1. Checks for missing columns in the restaurants table
2. Generates appropriate ALTER TABLE statements
3. Applies migrations safely with transaction support
4. Verifies the migration succeeded

## 📝 Changes Made

### New Files
- `/backend/scripts/migrate_database_columns.py` - Main migration tool
- `/backend/scripts/DATABASE_MIGRATION_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `/backend/scripts/digitalocean_migration.sh` - DigitalOcean deployment script

### Features
- ✅ Safe, non-destructive migration (only adds columns)
- ✅ Dry-run mode with `--check-only` flag
- ✅ Automated mode with `--force` flag
- ✅ Colored output for better visibility
- ✅ Transaction support with rollback on failure
- ✅ Post-migration verification
- ✅ Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
cd backend
# Check what's missing (safe)
python scripts/migrate_database_columns.py --check-only

# Apply migration
python scripts/migrate_database_columns.py
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Via DigitalOcean console
cd backend
./scripts/digitalocean_migration.sh
```

## 📊 Migration Details

The tool adds these missing columns:
```sql
ALTER TABLE restaurants
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS floor_plan_layout JSONB,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_plan VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'alpha',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'trial',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_started_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- No hardcoded credentials
- DATABASE_URL must be provided via environment
- Read-only inspection mode available
- No data deletion or modification
- All operations wrapped in transactions

## 📋 Pre-merge Checklist

- [x] Code follows project conventions
- [x] Comprehensive documentation provided
- [x] Scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Verification step included
- [x] Safe for production use

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Merge this PR**
2. **Run migration on DigitalOcean**:
   ```bash
   # In DigitalOcean console
   cd backend
   ./scripts/digitalocean_migration.sh
   ```
3. **Verify fix**:
   - Check runtime logs for "column does not exist" errors (should be gone)
   - Test user authentication
   - Monitor WebSocket connections

## 🔗 Related Issues

- Fixes "No restaurant associated with user" WebSocket errors
- Resolves API timeout issues caused by database errors
- Addresses SQLAlchemy model caching problems
- Implements proper database schema synchronization

## 💡 Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Restart app to clear cache** - Temporary fix, doesn't solve root issue
2. **Remove columns from model** - Already tried in PR #305, didn't work due to caching
3. **Full Alembic migration system** - Overkill for this specific issue

## 📚 Additional Notes

This is a critical fix that needs to be deployed ASAP to restore authentication functionality. The migration tool is designed to be safe and can be run multiple times without risk.

After this migration, users should be able to:
- Sign in successfully
- Connect to WebSocket
- Access their restaurant data
- See subscription information
