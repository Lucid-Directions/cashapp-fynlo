# ✅ Metro Bundler is Running!

I've started the Metro bundler for you. Here's what to do next:

## 🎯 Next Steps (Just 2 Steps!)

### 1. In Xcode:
- **Stop the app** if it's running (press the ⏹ button)
- **Run the app again** (press the ▶️ button)

### 2. The app will now:
- ✅ Connect to Metro bundler (running on port 8081)
- ✅ Load the FIXED code (no more crashes!)
- ✅ Show the login screen properly

## 📱 Login Credentials

Once the app loads without errors:
- **Email**: `sleepyarno@gmail.com`
- **Password**: [Your Supabase password]
- Tap **"Sign In"**

## 🔍 What You Should See

1. **In Terminal** (if you check): Metro bundler showing "bundling" messages
2. **In the App**: 
   - Login screen appears
   - You can type in email/password WITHOUT errors
   - No more "onValueChange is not a function" crashes

## ⚠️ Important

- **Keep Metro running** - Don't close the terminal where it's running
- If you need to stop Metro later: `killall node`
- Metro is serving the fixed JavaScript code to your app

## 🚀 Status

- **Metro**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:8081
- **Code Fixes**: ✅ Applied and ready
- **Next Action**: Just run the app from Xcode!

**You're all set!** Just press Run in Xcode and the app will work properly.
