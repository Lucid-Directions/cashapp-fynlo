## üîê Security Improvements Summary

### 1. **Authentication Security** (CRITICAL)
- **Removed**: Mock authentication endpoints with hardcoded credentials
- **Removed**: `/api/v1/auth/login` bypass endpoints
- **Enforced**: Supabase authentication for all environments
- **Impact**: Eliminates authentication bypass vulnerability

### 2. **API Key Security** (HIGH)
- **Removed**: Hardcoded SumUp API keys from codebase
- **Implemented**: Secure backend configuration service
- **Protected**: API keys now server-side only
- **Impact**: Prevents API key exposure in client code

### 3. **Configuration Security** (MEDIUM)
- **Changed**: GET to POST for sensitive configuration endpoints
- **Added**: Proper request validation
- **Improved**: Error handling without exposing sensitive data
- **Impact**: Reduces attack surface for configuration endpoints
