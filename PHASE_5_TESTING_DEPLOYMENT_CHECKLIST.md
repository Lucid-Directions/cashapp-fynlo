### ðŸš€ End-to-End Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Complete Order Flow
```gherkin
Given a logged-in employee
When they create a new order
  And add multiple items with modifiers
  And apply a discount
  And process payment via card
Then the order should be saved
  And inventory should be updated
  And receipt should be generated
  And analytics should reflect the sale
```

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Restaurant Management
```gherkin
Given a platform owner
When they create a new restaurant
  And configure menu items
  And add employees
  And set business hours
Then the restaurant should be operational
  And accessible only to assigned users
  And have isolated data
```

#### Scenario 3: Offline Functionality
```gherkin
Given the app is offline
When a user creates orders
  And processes cash payments
  And updates inventory
Then actions should queue
  And sync when online
  And resolve any conflicts
```
