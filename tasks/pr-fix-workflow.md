# PR Fix Workflow - Correcting PR #347 Security Issues

## Problem Summary
PR #347 introduced critical security vulnerabilities:
- Hardcoded JWT tokens in check_user_api.py and fix_restaurant_via_api.py
- Hardcoded email address in fix_user_restaurant.py
- Debug scripts that should never be in version control

Instead of fixing PR #347 directly, two new PRs (#348, #349) were created, which is incorrect workflow.

## Correct Git Workflow for Fixing PRs

### ❌ What NOT to do (what happened here):
1. Create PR #347 with issues
2. Create new PR #348 to fix some issues
3. Create another PR #349 to fix security issues
4. End up with 3 PRs for what should be 1 fix

### ✅ What TO do (correct workflow):
```bash
# 1. Checkout the original PR branch
git checkout fix/auth-verify-error-handling

# 2. Make all necessary fixes in this branch
# - Remove sensitive files
# - Fix the actual issues
# - Update .gitignore

# 3. Commit the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: remove sensitive data and improve security"

# 4. Push to update the SAME PR
git push origin fix/auth-verify-error-handling
```

This way, PR #347 gets updated with all fixes, maintaining a clean history.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Security Actions (URGENT)
- The exposed JWT tokens must be invalidated immediately
- Check access logs for any unauthorized usage
- Rotate affected credentials

### 2. Close Redundant PRs
- PR #348 and #349 should be closed as they're fixing issues that should be fixed in PR #347

### 3. Fix PR #347 Properly
All changes should be made in the `fix/auth-verify-error-handling` branch:
- Remove all sensitive files
- Implement proper WebSocket handling
- Update .gitignore
- Push changes to update PR #347

## Why This Matters
1. **Clean Git History**: One PR = One feature/fix
2. **Easy Review**: Reviewers see all related changes in one place
3. **Better Tracking**: Issues and discussions stay in one PR
4. **Simpler Merges**: No conflicts between multiple related PRs

## Lesson Learned
Always fix issues in the original PR branch rather than creating new PRs. This maintains a clean, understandable Git history and makes code review much easier.
