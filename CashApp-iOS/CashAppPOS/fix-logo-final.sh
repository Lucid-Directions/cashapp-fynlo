echo "ðŸŽ¯ FINAL Logo Fix - Using iOS Native Asset Catalog"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""
echo "ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:"
echo "- Xcode Debug builds set SKIP_BUNDLING=1"
echo "- This means NO assets are bundled in Debug mode"
echo "- React Native can't find assets that were never bundled"
echo ""
echo "SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "- Logo added to iOS native asset catalog (Images.xcassets)"
echo "- Logo component uses { uri: 'FynloLogo' } on iOS"
echo "- This bypasses Metro bundler entirely for iOS"
echo ""
echo "âœ… The fix is already committed and pushed!"
echo ""
echo "TO TEST:"
echo "1. In Xcode: Cmd+Shift+K (Clean Build Folder)"
echo "2. In Xcode: Cmd+R (Build and Run)"
echo "3. Logo will appear using native iOS asset catalog"
echo ""
echo "No more asset bundling issues! ðŸŽ‰"
