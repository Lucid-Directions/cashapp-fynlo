# Feature: Inventory Management and Order Details Improvements

## Summary
This PR implements significant UI/UX improvements to the Orders, Inventory, and Platform screens based on user feedback. The main focus is on transforming the inventory system from tracking finished meals to tracking raw ingredients, adding order detail functionality, and fixing critical navigation issues.

## Changes Made

### ðŸ›’ Orders Screen
- **Added order detail modal** - Users can now click on any order to see full details
  - Shows complete order information (ID, date/time, customer, employee)
  - Displays payment method and order status
  - Includes order summary with itemized breakdown and VAT calculation
  - Provides action buttons for processing refunds and resending receipts
- **Maintained existing functionality** - All filtering and search features remain intact

### ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management
- **Complete overhaul from meals to ingredients**
  - Changed from tracking finished dishes (Nachos, Tacos) to raw ingredients (Potatoes, Tomatoes, Onions, etc.)
  - Updated categories: Vegetables, Proteins, Dairy, Grains, Condiments, Tortillas
  - This gives restaurant managers granular control over stock levels
- **Added floating action button (+)** for adding new inventory items
- **Implemented comprehensive add item modal** with fields for:
  - Item name and category selection
  - Unit cost and current stock levels
  - Min/max stock thresholds
  - Supplier information
- **Fixed QR scanner button** - Now shows alert about hardware integration

### ðŸ‘¤ Platform Dashboard
- **Fixed critical logout bug** - Changed from `logout()` to `signOut()` to match AuthContext
- **Added sign out button** with confirmation dialog
- Users are no longer stuck in the platform view

### ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements
- **Added missing back button** to Settings screen
- **Fixed menu item display** - Changed from `image` to `emoji` property in MockDataService
- **Improved logo alignment** in POS screen for better visual balance
- **Created sanity check documentation** for tracking all fixes

### ðŸ”§ Technical Additions
- **Created ingredient mapping system** (`src/utils/ingredientMapping.ts`)
  - Maps menu items to their required ingredients with quantities
  - Functions to calculate ingredient requirements for orders
  - Can check inventory availability and identify shortages
  - Foundation for future inventory deduction on order completion

## Screenshots/Testing
- âœ… Orders screen - Click any order to see details modal
- âœ… Inventory screen - Shows ingredients instead of meals, (+) button to add items
- âœ… Platform dashboard - Sign out button works correctly
- âœ… All "More" menu screens have back buttons
- âœ… Menu items display emojis correctly

## Backend Considerations
All changes are designed to maintain compatibility with Ryan's upcoming backend integration:
- No modifications to API service structure
- MockDataService changes are isolated and easily replaceable
- Inventory tracking logic is prepared for real-time updates
- Order details structure matches expected backend format

## Next Steps
After this PR is merged, the next priorities would be:
1. Connect ingredient tracking to order processing (deduct ingredients when orders complete)
2. Add low stock alerts and automated reordering suggestions
3. Implement barcode scanning when hardware is available
4. Create inventory reports showing usage patterns
