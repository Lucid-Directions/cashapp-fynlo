## **üö® CRITICAL: Development Environment Setup & Cache Issues** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **Metro Bundler Cache Issue Resolution** ‚úÖ
- [x] **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Xcode was configured to use static `main.jsbundle` files instead of connecting to live Metro bundler
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: Static bundle references in `ios/CashAppPOS.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` were causing cached versions to load
- [x] **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: 
  - Removed all static bundle references from Xcode project configuration
  - Deleted cached `main.jsbundle` files from iOS directories
  - Ensured Metro bundler connects directly to live development server
- [x] **VERIFICATION**: App now shows live changes with "FYNLO POS SYSTEM" header and correct navigation tabs
- [x] **DOCUMENTATION**: This fix documented to prevent future cache issues

### **Critical Development Commands** ‚úÖ
- [x] **Metro Reset**: `npx react-native start --reset-cache` - Clears all Metro caches
- [x] **iOS Clean**: `cd ios && xcodebuild clean -workspace CashAppPOS.xcworkspace -scheme CashAppPOS`
- [x] **Bundle Removal**: Remove any `main.jsbundle` files from iOS directories
- [x] **Live Development**: Always ensure Metro is running before building iOS app

### **Signs of Cache Issues**
- App showing old implementations despite code changes
- Xcode error: `lstat(...main.jsbundle): No such file or directory` (this is GOOD - means no cached bundle)
- Changes not reflecting in simulator/device
- Old navigation structure or currency symbols appearing

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: If changes don't appear, check for static bundle files and remove them immediately!
