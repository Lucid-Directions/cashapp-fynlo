# Supabase Integration Status Summary

## Current Situation (January 12, 2025)

### ✅ What's Already Done

1. **Supabase Account & Configuration**
   - Supabase project exists: `https://eweggzpvuqczrrrwszyy.supabase.co`
   - All credentials are properly configured in `.env`
   - Backend code is ready to use Supabase authentication

2. **Backend Code**
   - `app/core/auth.py` - Already configured to validate Supabase tokens
   - `app/core/supabase.py` - Supabase client initialization exists
   - Migration file exists: `009_add_supabase_auth_support.py`
   - Helper scripts exist: `get_supabase_token.py`, `test_supabase_auth.py`

3. **Frontend**
   - Mobile app already uses Supabase for authentication
   - Successfully signs in users to Supabase

### ❌ What's Missing

1. **Database Migration Not Applied**
   - The migration to add `supabase_id` and `auth_provider` columns hasn't been run
   - This is why the backend can't link Supabase users to local database users

2. **User Synchronization**
   - You mentioned users exist in Supabase, but they're not linked to the database
   - Need to either:
     - Create matching records in the database
     - Or update existing records with Supabase IDs

3. **Mock Authentication Still Active**
   - `main.py` still has mock endpoints that bypass Supabase
   - These should be removed once real auth is working

## Action Plan

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
cd backend
python run_pending_migrations.py
# Type 'yes' when prompted
```

### Step 2: Create/Link Users
After migration, we need to:
1. Check which users exist in Supabase
2. Create matching records in our database OR
3. Link existing database users to their Supabase IDs

### Step 3: Test Authentication Flow
1. Use the mobile app to sign in with Supabase credentials
2. Verify the backend accepts the token
3. Confirm user data is properly loaded

### Step 4: Clean Up
1. Remove mock authentication from `main.py`
2. Update documentation

## Important Notes

- **No Work Will Be Duplicated**: The migration only adds columns if they don't exist
- **No Data Will Be Lost**: Migrations are designed to be safe and reversible
- **Existing Users**: Your Supabase users will remain intact
- **SUMUP_MERCHANT_CODE**: This is for payment processing, unrelated to auth

## Summary

You have a **90% complete** Supabase integration. The only missing piece is running the database migration to add the necessary columns. Once that's done, your existing Supabase users (like arnaud@luciddirections.co.uk) will be able to authenticate properly through the backend.
