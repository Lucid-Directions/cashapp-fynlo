Deployment trigger file
Last updated: 2025-08-01 13:50:00 UTC

This file forces DigitalOcean to create a new deployment.
The backend has been failing to deploy due to:
1. Syntax errors in Python files (fixed in PR #485)
2. Incorrect run command in app spec (should be app.main:app not backend.app.main:app)

This deployment should succeed with all fixes applied.
