        # Assumption 1: Tips are entirely separate from Service Charge. SC doesn't reduce tip pool.
        # Assumption 2: Service Charge is "in lieu of tips" or partially replaces tips.
        # The issue: "Service Charge includes transaction fees, reducing actual staff tips"
        # This implies that the *service charge itself* (if it was meant for staff) is reduced by the fees it absorbed.
        # And "Transaction fee impact display" / "Transaction fee impact on tips"
        # This suggests the tips themselves might be reduced if they are used to cover fees,
        # OR that the overall pool for staff (tips + service_charge_for_staff) is reduced.

        # Let's assume `total_tips_collected` is purely what the customer designated as a "tip".
        # The `processor_fee_covered_by_service_charge` reduces the *service charge* amount that might go to staff,
        # not directly the `total_tips_collected` unless tips are used to pay SC.

        # For now, let's assume `total_tips_collected` is the net distributable tip pool from actual tips.
        # The "reduction of staff tips due to service charge" might mean that if SC is high, customers tip less,
        # or that if SC is meant for staff, that SC amount is reduced by the fees it absorbed.
        # The `transaction_fee_impact` field in `staff_tip_distributions` table suggests a direct impact.

        # Scenario A: `total_tips_collected` is the only pool. `processor_fee_covered_by_service_charge`
        #             is for informational purposes on how SC was structured but doesn't touch this tip pool.
        # Scenario B: The "actual staff tips" mentioned in "Gap 3" means the distributable amount from tips
        #             is reduced if the service charge (which might also go to staff) had to cover fees.
        #             This is complex.

        # Let's go with a clearer model:
        # `distributable_tips = total_tips_collected`
        # `service_charge_net_for_staff = service_charge_amount_on_order - processor_fee_covered_by_service_charge`
        # The service will distribute `distributable_tips`.
        # The `transaction_fee_impact` on the `StaffTipDistributionRecord` will be calculated per staff based on their share of `processor_fee_covered_by_service_charge` IF the SC was supposed to go to them.

        # For this function, let's focus on distributing `total_tips_collected`.
        # The impact of `processor_fee_covered_by_service_charge` will be recorded per staff member,
        # assuming it reduces a separate pool (like service charge intended for staff).
