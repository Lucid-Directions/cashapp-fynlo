    # The `limiter` object we created earlier will be used by route decorators.
    # We need to ensure that the `RateLimiter` state is configured with our Redis client.
    # This is a bit of a workaround for how `fastapi-limiter` handles its global state
    # when not using `FastAPILimiter.init()`.

    # The `limiter` instance itself should use the `redis_client` through its `key_func`
    # and how it stores data.
    # `fastapi-limiter` uses a global `_DEFAULT_LIMITER` if you don't pass one
    # to `FastAPILimiter.init()`. Since we are using decorators with our `limiter` instance,
    # it should pick up our Redis client automatically.

    # The key part is that `redis_client.get_client()` must return a valid
    # `redis.asyncio.Redis` instance or a compatible object.
    # Our `RedisClient.get_client()` is designed to do this.

    # No explicit global state init for `fastapi-limiter` is needed here if decorators
    # are used with our `limiter` instance, as it will use the `storage_uri` implicitly
    # from the `redis_client` if it were set up that way, or use the client directly.
    # The `fastapi-limiter` documentation is a bit sparse on custom client injection
    # without the global init.

    # However, if we were to use `app.state.limiter = limiter` and then use
    # `request.state.limiter` in dependencies, this would be cleaner.
    # For now, the global `limiter` instance should work with decorators.

# Custom exception handler for RateLimitExceeded to provide a standard API response.
# This is already handled by slowapi's default handler if we add it to the app.
# We can customize it if needed.

# --- Application of Limits ---
# Limits will be applied via decorators on specific routes/routers in `api.py` or endpoint files.
# Example:
# from app.middleware.rate_limit_middleware import limiter
#
# @router.post("/login")
# @limiter.limit("5/minute") # Applied to the key from identify_client
# async def login(...):
#     ...

# This file primarily sets up the `limiter` instance.
# The actual middleware registration (`app.add_middleware(SlowAPIMiddleware)`) and
# exception handler (`app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)`)
# will be done in `main.py`.
# And `init_fastapi_limiter` will also be called in `main.py`'s lifespan.

# Define default limits (can be overridden by decorators)
DEFAULT_RATE = "60/minute"

# Define specific limits for endpoint categories
AUTH_RATE = "5/minute"
PAYMENT_RATE = "15/minute"  # As per requirement "10-20", using 15

# Portal vs Mobile specific limits
MOBILE_APP_RATE = "100/minute"
PORTAL_DASHBOARD_RATE = "300/minute"  # Higher for analytics
PORTAL_EXPORT_RATE = "10/minute"  # Lower for resource-intensive operations

# API-specific limits
ANALYTICS_RATE = "200/minute"  # High for dashboard queries
WEBSOCKET_RATE = "500/minute"  # Very high for real-time updates
SYNC_RATE = "200/minute"  # High for synchronization

    f"Rate Limiter Configured: DEFAULT_RATE={DEFAULT_RATE}, AUTH_RATE={AUTH_RATE}, PAYMENT_RATE={PAYMENT_RATE}"
