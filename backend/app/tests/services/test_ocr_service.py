# To run these tests (assuming pytest is set up and in the backend directory):
# Ensure __init__.py files are present in app/tests and app/tests/services if needed for discovery.
# Command: PYTHONPATH=. pytest app/tests/services/test_ocr_service.py

# Note: These tests are for the MOCK ocr_service.
# Actual OCR parsing tests would require:
# 1. Integration with a real OCR library/service.
# 2. Sample receipt images (JPG/PDF) from different vendors.
# 3. More complex assertions on the extracted and structured data.
# 4. Handling of various OCR challenges (blurry images, different formats, etc.).
# The requirement "Unit tests (OCR parser) PDFs/JPG invoices (3 vendors) â†’ expect correct JSON"
# implies testing the real parsing, which is currently out of scope for BE-2 in the plan.
# These tests cover QA-1 for the *current state* of the mocked OCR service.
# Coverage for the real parser would be part of BE-2 implementation.

# Add __init__.py files if they don't exist
# backend/app/tests/__init__.py (empty file)
# backend/app/tests/services/__init__.py (empty file)
