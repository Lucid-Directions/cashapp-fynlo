# ðŸš¨ DigitalOcean Deployment Issues Analysis

## Problem Summary
- Auto-deployment from GitHub is not triggering
- Manual deployments are being cancelled automatically
- DigitalOcean is rolling back to the last working version
- Recent changes are not being deployed

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Deployment Configuration Status
- **Spec File**: `backend/deploy/spec.yaml` exists and is properly configured
- **Dockerfile**: Located at `backend/Dockerfile` (correct path)
- **Auto-deploy**: Set to `deploy_on_push: true` for main branch
- **Health Check**: Currently commented out in spec.yaml (lines 42-48)

### 2. Recent Changes That Could Affect Deployment

#### a) Health Check Endpoint Changes
- Modified `/health` endpoint to remove DB/Redis checks
- This was done to fix timeout issues
- However, the Dockerfile still has HEALTHCHECK configured (line 36)
- The spec.yaml has health_check commented out

#### b) Database Dependencies
- Multiple recent commits added database operations
- Supabase integration scripts
- User linking functionality
- These require DATABASE_URL to be properly set

### 3. Potential Issues Identified

#### Issue 1: Health Check Mismatch
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile line 36:
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=30s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```

But the spec.yaml has health check disabled. This mismatch could cause deployment issues.

#### Issue 2: Environment Variables
The deployment might be failing due to missing environment variables:
- DATABASE_URL (marked as SECRET in spec.yaml)
- REDIS_URL (marked as SECRET in spec.yaml)
- SUPABASE_URL (not in spec.yaml but used in code)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (not in spec.yaml but used in code)

#### Issue 3: Build Context
The spec.yaml specifies:
- `dockerfile_path: backend/Dockerfile`
- But no `source_dir` is specified

This might cause confusion about the build context.

## Recommended Fix Plan

### 1. Update spec.yaml
```yaml
services:
  - name: api
    dockerfile_path: backend/Dockerfile
    source_dir: backend  # ADD THIS LINE
    github:
      repo: Lucid-Directions/cashapp-fynlo
      branch: main
      deploy_on_push: true
```

### 2. Re-enable Health Check in spec.yaml
Since we fixed the health endpoint, we should re-enable it:
```yaml
    health_check:
      http_path: /health
      initial_delay_seconds: 30  # Reduced from 60
      period_seconds: 30
      timeout_seconds: 10
      failure_threshold: 3       # Reduced from 5
      success_threshold: 1
```

### 3. Add Missing Environment Variables
Add to spec.yaml:
```yaml
      - key: SUPABASE_URL
        scope: RUN_TIME
        type: SECRET
      - key: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
        scope: RUN_TIME
        type: SECRET
```

### 4. Verify All Secrets in DigitalOcean Dashboard
Ensure these are set:
- DATABASE_URL
- REDIS_URL  
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

### 5. Check Build Logs
In DigitalOcean dashboard:
1. Go to your app
2. Click on "Activity" tab
3. Look for failed deployments
4. Click "View Logs" to see specific errors

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Check DigitalOcean Activity/Logs** - This will show the exact error
2. **Update spec.yaml** with the fixes above
3. **Verify all environment variables** are set in DigitalOcean
4. **Create a test deployment** with a simple commit

## Common DigitalOcean Deployment Failure Reasons

1. **Build failures** - Missing dependencies, syntax errors
2. **Health check failures** - App not responding on expected port
3. **Environment variable issues** - Missing required secrets
4. **Memory limits** - App exceeding instance size limits
5. **Port binding issues** - App not listening on port 8080

## Next Steps

1. First, check the DigitalOcean Activity logs for the specific error
2. Apply the spec.yaml fixes
3. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
4. Test with a minimal change to trigger deployment
