# Note: To make these tests more robust and less reliant on the full execution of `refund_order`,
# the permission check logic could be refactored into its own dependency function.
# For example: `def get_current_active_manager(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user), db: Session = Depends(get_db)): ...`
# Then, this new dependency can be mocked more easily or tested in isolation.
# The current tests will try to proceed past the permission check and likely fail due to other missing mocks,
# so they primarily test that the 403 is NOT raised for allowed roles, or IS raised for denied roles.
