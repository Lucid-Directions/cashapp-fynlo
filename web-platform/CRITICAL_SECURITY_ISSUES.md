# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Date Discovered**: January 2025
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Data Breach Risk
**Status**: ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED âœ…
**Fix Applied**: January 2025

## Summary

Multiple components in the web platform are fetching ALL restaurants and sensitive data without proper access control checks. This allows ANY authenticated user to view data from ALL restaurants in the system.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. âœ… FIXED: Service Charge Modification
- **File**: `src/components/restaurant/dashboard/RestaurantSettings.tsx`
- **Issue**: Restaurants could modify platform-controlled service_charge rate
- **Fix Applied**: Changed to read-only display with lock icon, hardcoded to 12.5%

### 2. âœ… FIXED: BusinessManagement Component
- **File**: `src/components/dashboard/BusinessManagement.tsx`
- **Issue**: Fetches ALL restaurants without access control
- **Code**:
  ```typescript
  const { data: restaurantData, error } = await supabase
    .from('restaurants')
    .select('*')  // NO FILTERING - EXPOSES ALL RESTAURANTS
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
  ```
- **Impact**: Any user can see all restaurants, owners, addresses, phone numbers

### 3. âœ… FIXED: StaffManagement Component  
- **File**: `src/components/dashboard/StaffManagement.tsx`
- **Issue**: Fetches ALL restaurants and ALL staff members
- **Code**:
  ```typescript
  // Fetches ALL restaurants
  const { data: restaurantsData } = await supabase
    .from('restaurants')
    .select('id, name, is_active')
    .order('name');

  // Fetches ALL staff members across ALL restaurants
  const { data: staffData } = await supabase
    .from('staff_members')
    .select('*')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
  ```
- **Impact**: Exposes employee data, roles, and restaurant associations

### 4. âœ… FIXED: LocationManagement Component
- **File**: `src/components/dashboard/LocationManagement.tsx`
- **Issue**: Fetches ALL restaurants and their statistics
- **Code**:
  ```typescript
  const { data: restaurantsData } = await supabase
    .from('restaurants')
    .select('*')  // NO ACCESS CONTROL
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
  ```
- **Impact**: Exposes all restaurant data, revenue statistics, staff counts

## Required Fixes

### For Platform Owner Components
Components that should ONLY be accessible to platform owners need explicit checks:
```typescript
const { isPlatformOwner } = useFeatureAccess();

const fetchRestaurants = async () => {
  if (!isPlatformOwner) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized: Platform owner access required');
  }
  // ... fetch all restaurants
};
```

### For Restaurant Owner Components
Components for restaurant owners should filter by ownership:
```typescript
const { user } = useAuth();

const fetchMyRestaurants = async () => {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('restaurants')
    .select('*')
    .eq('owner_id', user?.id)  // Only owned restaurants
    .eq('is_active', true);
};
```

### For Staff Member Access
Staff should only see their assigned restaurant:
```typescript
const { fynloUserData } = useAuth();

const fetchRestaurantData = async () => {
  if (!fynloUserData?.restaurant_id) {
    throw new Error('No restaurant assigned');
  }
  
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('restaurants')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', fynloUserData.restaurant_id)  // Only assigned restaurant
    .single();
};
```

## Recommended Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Add access control checks to all affected components
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Audit ALL Supabase queries for similar vulnerabilities
3. **URGENT**: Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
4. **URGENT**: Add integration tests for access control
5. **IMPORTANT**: Security audit of entire codebase

## Testing Access Control

After fixes, verify that:
1. Platform owners can see all restaurants
2. Restaurant owners can only see their own restaurants
3. Staff members can only see their assigned restaurant
4. Unauthenticated users cannot access any data

## Notes

- These vulnerabilities exist because components rely on route guards for access control, but the API calls themselves are not protected
- Even if the UI prevents navigation, a malicious user could still make direct API calls
- This is why defense in depth is critical - protect at UI, API, and database levels
