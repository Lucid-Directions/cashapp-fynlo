# PR Guardian Analysis - SumUp Security Fix

**Branch**: fix/remove-hardcoded-sumup-api-key  
**Issue**: #386 - Remove hardcoded SumUp API key from mobile app  
**Priority**: CRITICAL SECURITY FIX  
**Status**: READY TO MERGE ✅

## 1. Security Analysis 🔒

### Vulnerabilities Fixed
- ✅ **Hardcoded API Key Removed**: Successfully removed `sup_sk_XqquMi732f2WDCqvnkV4xoVxx54oGAQRU` from all mobile app source files
