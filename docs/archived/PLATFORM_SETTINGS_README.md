# Platform Settings Hierarchy Implementation

This branch implements a multi-tenant settings architecture for the Fynlo POS system, separating platform-controlled settings from restaurant-controlled settings.

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Revenue Protection**: Move payment processing fees to platform control
2. **Consistency**: Ensure uniform compliance and security across all restaurants  
3. **Scalability**: Enable easy feature rollouts and A/B testing
4. **Flexibility**: Maintain restaurant autonomy for operational settings

## üìã Key Changes

### Critical Migrations
- **Payment processing fees** ‚Üí Platform controlled
- **Provider configurations** ‚Üí Platform managed
- **Security settings** ‚Üí Platform enforced
- **Feature flags** ‚Üí Platform synchronized

### Preserved Restaurant Control
- Business information and branding
- Operating hours and staff management
- Tax rates and local compliance
- Hardware and customer experience preferences

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Python 3.11+ and pip
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis (for caching)

### Installation
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies  
cd CashApp-iOS/CashAppPOS
npm install

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start development servers
# Backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend
npm start
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Platform settings
FYNLO_PLATFORM_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
FYNLO_PLATFORM_SYNC_INTERVAL=300

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/fynlo_pos

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Authentication
FYNLO_ADMIN_TOKEN=your_admin_token_here
```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest tests/test_platform_settings.py -v

# Frontend tests
cd CashApp-iOS/CashAppPOS
npm test -- --testPathPattern=PlatformStore
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test settings synchronization
pytest tests/test_settings_sync.py -v

# Test restaurant override validation
pytest tests/test_settings_validation.py -v
```

## üìä Key Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Settings sync success rate: Target 99.9%
- Sync latency: Target < 100ms
- Configuration validation: 100% compliance
- Zero unauthorized fee modifications

### Business KPIs
- Revenue protection: 100% fee control
- Restaurant satisfaction: > 90%
- Support ticket reduction: Target 50%
- Onboarding time reduction: Target 75%

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Platform settings require admin-level authentication
2. **Audit Trail**: All configuration changes are logged with user attribution
3. **Encryption**: Sensitive settings (API keys) encrypted at rest and in transit
4. **Validation**: All restaurant overrides validated against platform rules
5. **Rate Limiting**: Configuration endpoints protected against abuse

## üö® Demo Mode Preservation

**IMPORTANT**: Demo mode functionality is preserved for investor presentations:
- Payment simulation alerts remain active
- No real payment processing during demos
- All provider integrations show simulation dialogs
- Demo mode can be toggled via feature flag

## üìû Support

### Technical Issues
- Check the [troubleshooting guide](docs/PLATFORM_SETTINGS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md#support--troubleshooting)
- Review logs in `backend/logs/platform_settings.log`
- Monitor sync status in the admin dashboard

### Architecture Questions
- Review the [architecture document](docs/PLATFORM_SETTINGS_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Check the [migration plan](docs/PLATFORM_SETTINGS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
- Consult the [settings audit](docs/SETTINGS_AUDIT_REPORT.md)

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Full database backup completed
- [ ] Staging environment validated
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Restaurant communication sent
- [ ] Support team briefed

### Migration Steps
1. Deploy platform settings infrastructure
2. Create platform configuration records
3. Migrate restaurant settings to overrides
4. Validate all configurations
5. Enable platform settings sync
6. Monitor for 48 hours

### Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] All restaurants can sync settings
- [ ] Payment fees match platform configuration
- [ ] No unauthorized modifications detected
- [ ] Restaurant functionality unchanged
