## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (T-30 minutes)
- [ ] **Notify team** of upcoming deployment via Slack/Email
- [ ] **Final test suite** run on staging
  ```bash
  cd backend && pytest tests/ -v
  cd ../CashApp-iOS/CashAppPOS && npm test
  ```
- [ ] **Backup production database**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/backup_database.sh
  ```
- [ ] **Review deployment plan** with team
- [ ] **Check system status** - No ongoing incidents

### Phase 2: Deployment (15-30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Prepare Environment
- [ ] Set maintenance mode (optional)
  ```bash
  # If using maintenance mode
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python scripts/set_maintenance_mode.py on
  ```
- [ ] Pull latest code
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  ```

#### Step 2: Deploy Backend
- [ ] Run deployment script
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy.sh production main
  ```
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f backend
  ```

#### Step 3: Database Updates
- [ ] Migrations applied automatically by deploy script
- [ ] Verify migration success
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic current
  ```

#### Step 4: Cache and Services
- [ ] Cache warming completed
- [ ] WebSocket service restarted
- [ ] Background tasks running

### Phase 3: Verification (15 minutes)

#### Health Checks
- [ ] Basic health check passing
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
  ```
- [ ] Detailed health check - all components healthy
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/detailed | jq .
  ```

#### Critical User Flows
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Menu loading correctly
- [ ] Order creation successful
- [ ] Payment processing functional
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable
- [ ] Analytics dashboard loading

#### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Response times within thresholds
- [ ] No error spikes in logs
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 50%

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment (1 hour monitoring)

#### First 15 Minutes
- [ ] Monitor error rates closely
- [ ] Check user feedback channels
- [ ] Verify all services stable
- [ ] Review performance metrics

#### First Hour
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] No critical alerts triggered
- [ ] User complaints addressed
- [ ] Performance baselines normal

#### Documentation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Database Migration Failure
```bash
# Check migration status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic history

# Manually apply migrations
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Rollback if needed
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic downgrade -1
```

#### 2. Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs backend

# Restart service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart backend

# Check configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config
```

#### 3. High Error Rate
```bash
# Check error logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs backend | grep ERROR

# Check Redis connection
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python -c "from app.core.redis_client import redis_client; import asyncio; asyncio.run(redis_client.ping())"

# Check database connection
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python -c "from app.core.database import engine; engine.connect()"
```

#### 4. Performance Issues
```bash
# Check slow queries
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/performance -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.data.database.query_patterns'

# Check cache performance
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/performance -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.data.cache'

# Run cache warming
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python scripts/warm_cache.py
```
