# Fynlo Professional Payment System Updates

## Overview
Transformed the app from a Mexican restaurant-specific POS to a professional, generic payment system that can serve any restaurant while maintaining Mexican restaurant menu content as the demo data.

## ✅ Key Changes Made

### 1. **Professional Fynlo Branding**

- ✅ **After:** Professional Fynlo branding with:
  - Clean dark blue-gray primary color (#2C3E50)
  - Modern blue accents (#3498DB)
  - Professional "F" logo fallback instead of taco emoji

  - Reduced shadows and cleaner styling

### 2. **Professional Color Scheme**
**POSScreen (`src/screens/main/POSScreen.tsx`)**
- ❌ **Before:** Mexican warm colors (oranges, reds, terracotta)
- ✅ **After:** Professional business colors:
  ```typescript
  primary: '#2C3E50',     // Professional dark blue-gray
  secondary: '#3498DB',   // Modern blue
  accent: '#E74C3C',      // Professional red
  success: '#27AE60',     // Modern green

### 5. **Fixed Fork & Knife Icon Crash**

### 6. **Removed Spanish/Mexican Language Elements**

### 7. **Navigation Structure Cleanup**
