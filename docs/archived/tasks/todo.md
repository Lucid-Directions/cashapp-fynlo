## Progress Summary

### Phase 1 Backend Integration (95% Complete)
**Completed:**
1. ✅ Added Supabase dependencies (supabase==2.3.0, gotrue==2.0.0) to requirements.txt
2. ✅ Updated .env.example with Supabase configuration template
3. ✅ Created Supabase client module (app/core/supabase.py)
4. ✅ Created database migration for Supabase support (009_add_supabase_auth_support.py)
5. ✅ Backed up existing auth.py → auth_backup.py
6. ✅ Created new Supabase auth endpoints with /verify and /register-restaurant
7. ✅ Created auth schemas (RegisterRestaurantRequest, UserInfo, AuthVerifyResponse)
8. ✅ Created new authentication middleware (app/core/auth.py) with all role checks
9. ✅ Updated main.py CORS to include Supabase domains
10. ✅ Updated database models with Supabase fields
11. ✅ Created test scripts (test_supabase_auth.py, get_supabase_token.py)
12. ✅ Created backend setup documentation (SUPABASE_SETUP.md)

**Remaining Tasks:**
- Add credentials to .env and test Supabase connection
- Run the database migration
- Execute test scripts

### Phase 2 Mobile App Integration (40% Complete)
**Completed:**
1. ✅ Created Supabase configuration (src/lib/supabase.ts)
2. ✅ Created authentication service (src/services/auth/supabaseAuth.ts)
3. ✅ Created auth store with Zustand (src/store/useAuthStore.ts)
4. ✅ Created mobile setup documentation (CashAppPOS/SUPABASE_SETUP.md)

**Remaining Tasks:**
- Install npm dependencies
- Update .env file with credentials
- Update API client to use Supabase tokens
- Update LoginScreen and AuthContext
- Remove mock authentication code

### Key Changes Made:
- Backend: Authentication now uses Supabase tokens instead of JWT
- Mobile: Created complete Supabase integration layer
- Both: No more mock data or hardcoded credentials
- Comprehensive audit logging maintained for all auth events
- Platform owner features remain for now (future web migration)

## Review Section: Supabase Authentication Migration Summary

### What Was Accomplished Today

1. **Documentation Created**:
   - `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive migration plan with phases and checklists
   - `SUPABASE_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide for obtaining Supabase credentials
   - Backend and mobile setup guides created

2. **Backend Implementation (95% Complete)**:
   - Added Supabase dependencies to requirements.txt
   - Created Supabase client module (`app/core/supabase.py`)
   - Implemented new auth endpoints (`/verify`, `/register-restaurant`)
   - Created authentication middleware with token validation
   - Added database migration for Supabase support
   - Created test scripts for validation

3. **Mobile App Implementation (80% Complete)**:
   - Created Supabase configuration (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
   - Implemented authentication service (`src/services/auth/supabaseAuth.ts`)
   - Created Zustand auth store (`src/store/useAuthStore.ts`)
   - Updated API clients to use Supabase tokens
   - Modified LoginScreen to remove mock auth
   - Simplified AuthContext to bridge with new auth
   - Enhanced App.tsx with auth state management

### Security Improvements
- No more hardcoded credentials in the app
- Automatic token refresh on 401 errors
- Proper session persistence with AsyncStorage
- Service role key kept secure on backend only

### Next Steps Required
1. **Backend**: Add Supabase credentials to .env and run migration
2. **Mobile**: Install npm dependencies and update iOS pods
3. **Testing**: Verify authentication flow end-to-end
4. **Deployment**: Follow Phase 5 deployment checklist

### Important Notes
- All mock authentication has been removed
- Platform owner features remain in mobile app (future web migration)
- No data loss - existing user data will be migrated
- Authentication is now fully managed by Supabase

## Plan for Fixing POS Screen Menu Display

### Objective
Make the POS screen production-ready by fixing the blank menu display, header size inconsistency, API timeout issues, implementing proper menu management flow including functional import/export, adding error handling, and verifying database state. Ensure all changes follow security best practices, avoid code duplication, and consider dev/test/prod environments.

### Todo Items
- [ ] Verify current database state for menu data (run check_menu_data.py if available or query DB via terminal to check categories and products tables)
- [ ] Fix API timeout issues (optimize backend queries in menu.py to resolve N+1 issues, increase timeout in DatabaseService if needed, add retry logic with exponential backoff)
- [ ] Test Menu Management flow as restaurant owner (navigate to Settings -> App Settings -> Menu Management, add categories and items, verify they appear in POS screen after refresh)
- [ ] Implement actual import functionality in MenuManagementScreen.tsx (replace alert in handleImportMenu with file picker, JSON/CSV parsing, validation, and API call to create categories/items)
- [ ] Implement actual export functionality in MenuManagementScreen.tsx (replace alert in handleExportMenu with data collection from categories/items, generate JSON/CSV, and provide download/share options)
- [ ] Fix header size in POSScreen.tsx to match other screens (set height to 60 in styles, ensure consistency with OrdersScreen)
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states in POSScreen.tsx (implement LoadingView during menuLoading, EmptyState with CTA to Menu Management if no items, retry button on error)
- [ ] Update API response format in backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/menu.py to match frontend expectations (add emoji field, map is_active to available, transform category_id to category name)
- [ ] Add emoji field to Product model in backend/app/core/database.py and create Alembic migration
- [ ] Run seed script (python seed_chucho_menu.py) for testing if no data exists, then verify
- [ ] Remove temporary Chucho menu fallback in DatabaseService.ts once API is reliable
- [ ] Test full order flow from menu addition to payment, checking for any regressions
- [ ] Perform security review of all changes (ensure no sensitive data exposure, proper input sanitization in import)
- [ ] Create detailed pull request explaining all changes, with before/after screenshots
