## 🎯 MVP Definition
A **Minimum Viable Product** for Fynlo POS must enable a restaurant to:
1. Take orders (dine-in and takeout)
2. Process payments
3. Track daily sales
4. Manage basic table operations

## 📋 Critical Path to MVP (2-3 Weeks)

### Week 1: Core Restaurant Features
**Goal**: Enable basic restaurant operations

#### Day 1-2: Simple Table Management
```python
# Implement in /addons/pos_restaurant_features/
- Create table model with number and status
- Add table selection to order flow
- Implement order type (dine-in/takeout)
- Create basic table view in iOS app
```

#### Day 3-4: Order Status Workflow
```python
# Essential order states
- New → In Progress → Ready → Completed
- Add status to existing order model
- Create status update endpoints
- Implement real-time status updates
```

#### Day 5: Basic Kitchen View
```python
# Simple kitchen display
- List view of active orders
- Mark order as ready functionality
- Basic filtering by status
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
```

### Week 2: Essential Reports & Deployment

#### Day 1-2: Daily Sales Report
```python
# Implement in /addons/pos_analytics_reporting/
- Daily total sales
- Payment method breakdown
- Order count and average ticket
- Simple PDF/Excel export
```

#### Day 3: Transaction History
```python
# Basic reporting features
- List all transactions with filters
- Search by date, amount, payment type
- View order details
- Export functionality
```

#### Day 4-5: Production Setup
```bash
# Deployment checklist
- Set up production server (AWS/DigitalOcean)
- Configure PostgreSQL and Redis
- Set up SSL certificates
- Configure environment variables
- Set up backup system
```

### Week 3: App Store & Testing

#### Day 1-2: App Store Preparation
```bash
- Generate production build
- Create App Store screenshots
- Write app description
- Set up TestFlight
- Submit for review
```

#### Day 3-5: User Acceptance Testing
```bash
- Test in real restaurant environment
- Fix critical bugs
- Performance optimization
- Staff training materials
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Guide

### 1. Restaurant Features Implementation
```python
# /addons/pos_restaurant_features/models/pos_table.py
class PosTable(models.Model):
    _name = 'pos.table'
    
    name = fields.Char('Table Number', required=True)
    status = fields.Selection([
        ('available', 'Available'),
        ('occupied', 'Occupied'),
        ('reserved', 'Reserved')
    ], default='available')
    current_order_id = fields.Many2one('pos.order')
    capacity = fields.Integer('Seats', default=4)
```

### 2. Order Type Enhancement
```python
# /addons/point_of_sale_api/models/pos_order.py
# Add to existing model
order_type = fields.Selection([
    ('dine_in', 'Dine In'),
    ('takeout', 'Takeout'),
    ('delivery', 'Delivery')
], default='dine_in')
table_id = fields.Many2one('pos.table')
status = fields.Selection([
    ('new', 'New'),
    ('in_progress', 'In Progress'),
    ('ready', 'Ready'),
    ('completed', 'Completed')
], default='new')
```

### 3. iOS App Updates
```typescript
// Add to existing screens
// /CashApp-iOS/CashAppPOS/src/screens/main/TableSelectionScreen.tsx
interface Table {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'available' | 'occupied' | 'reserved';
  capacity: number;
}

// Simple grid view of tables
// Color coding by status
// Quick selection for new orders
```

### 4. Basic Analytics Implementation
```python
# /addons/pos_analytics_reporting/reports/daily_sales.py
class DailySalesReport:
    def generate_report(self, date):
        orders = self.env['pos.order'].search([
            ('date_order', '>=', date + ' 00:00:00'),
            ('date_order', '<=', date + ' 23:59:59'),
            ('state', 'in', ['paid', 'done'])
        ])
        
        return {
            'total_sales': sum(orders.mapped('amount_total')),
            'order_count': len(orders),
            'average_ticket': sum(orders.mapped('amount_total')) / len(orders) if orders else 0,
            'payment_methods': self._get_payment_breakdown(orders),
            'hourly_sales': self._get_hourly_breakdown(orders)
        }
```

## 📊 Success Metrics
- [ ] Restaurant can take 100+ orders per day
- [ ] Payment processing works reliably
- [ ] Daily reports generate in < 5 seconds
- [ ] App launches in < 2 seconds
- [ ] 99.9% uptime in production

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Criteria for Launch
1. ✅ All critical features working
2. ✅ Tested in real restaurant for 3 days
3. ✅ Staff can be trained in < 30 minutes
4. ✅ Daily reports accurate
5. ✅ Backup system operational
6. ✅ App Store approval received

## 📈 Post-MVP Roadmap
1. **Month 1**: Full analytics dashboard
2. **Month 2**: Kitchen display system
3. **Month 3**: Inventory management
4. **Month 4**: Customer loyalty program

## 💡 Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: App Store rejection
  - **Mitigation**: Submit early, have backup distribution plan
- **Risk**: Performance issues in busy restaurant
  - **Mitigation**: Load test with 1000+ orders, optimize critical paths
- **Risk**: Staff adoption
  - **Mitigation**: Simple UI, comprehensive training, on-site support

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Assign developers to Week 1 tasks
2. Set up daily standup meetings
3. Create shared progress tracker
4. Begin implementation immediately
