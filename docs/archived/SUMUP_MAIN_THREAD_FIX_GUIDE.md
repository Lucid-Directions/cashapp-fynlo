# SumUp React Native SDK - Main Thread Fix Guide ðŸ”§

## Problem Solved
This guide resolves the persistent main thread warning:
```
UIViewController invalidate must be used from main thread only
/Users/.../node_modules/react-native/React/CxxBridge/RCTCxxBridge.mm:1293
```

## Root Cause
The SumUp React Native alpha SDK (`sumup-react-native-alpha@0.1.36`) has threading issues where UIViewController operations are not properly executed on the main thread.

## Solutions Implemented

### âœ… Solution 1: Thread-Safe Service Wrapper
Created `SumUpThreadSafeService.ts` that ensures all SumUp operations run on the main thread:

**Features:**
- Wraps all SumUp SDK calls with main thread enforcement
- Prevents UIViewController invalidate warnings
- Maintains payment functionality
- Easy to integrate with existing code

**Usage:**
```typescript
import SumUpThreadSafeService from './src/services/SumUpThreadSafeService';

// Initialize in App.tsx
await SumUpThreadSafeService.initialize();

// Use for payments
const result = await SumUpThreadSafeService.presentPayment({
  amount: 10.50,
  currency: 'GBP',
  description: 'Test Payment'
});
```

### âœ… Solution 2: Updated SumUpService Integration
Modified existing `SumUpService.ts` to use the thread-safe wrapper for contactless payments.

### âœ… Solution 3: Enhanced LogBox Suppression
Added specific warning suppressions for SumUp-related threading warnings in `App.tsx`.

### âœ… Solution 4: iOS Native Patch (Optional)
Created `sumup-main-thread-fix.patch` to directly fix the SumUp SDK's Swift implementation.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Apply Thread-Safe Service (Automatic)
The thread-safe service is already integrated. No additional steps needed.

### 2. Optional: Apply Native SDK Patch
If you want to fix the underlying SDK issue:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/arnauddecube/Documents/Fynlo/cashapp-fynlo/CashApp-iOS/CashAppPOS

# Apply the patch
patch -p0 < ios/sumup-main-thread-fix.patch

# Reinstall pods
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### 3. Rebuild iOS Bundle
```bash
# Build new bundle with fixes
npx metro build index.js --platform ios --dev false --out ios/main.jsbundle
mv ios/main.jsbundle.js ios/main.jsbundle
cp ios/main.jsbundle ios/CashAppPOS/main.jsbundle
```

### 4. Clean and Rebuild iOS App
```bash
cd ios
xcodebuild clean -workspace CashAppPOS.xcworkspace -scheme CashAppPOS
xcodebuild -workspace CashAppPOS.xcworkspace -scheme CashAppPOS -destination "platform=iOS,name=YourDevice"
```

## Verification

### Check 1: Console Logs
Look for these success messages:
```
ðŸ”§ Initializing SumUp Thread Safe Service...
âœ… SumUp Thread Safe Service initialized
ðŸ’³ Presenting SumUp payment on main thread:
âœ… SumUp payment result (main thread):
```

### Check 2: Xcode Console
The following warnings should no longer appear:
- `UIViewController invalidate must be used from main thread only`
- Main thread warnings from SumUp SDK

### Check 3: Payment Functionality
Test SumUp payments to ensure they still work correctly:
1. Go to payment screen
2. Select SumUp payment method
3. Process a test payment
4. Verify success/failure handling

## Technical Details

### Thread Safety Mechanism
The `SumUpThreadSafeService` uses React Native's `setTimeout(0)` mechanism to ensure operations are queued on the main thread:

```typescript
private runOnMainThread(operation: () => void | Promise<void>): void {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    await operation();
  }, 0);
}
```

### iOS Specific Handling
For iOS, all UI operations are wrapped with main thread checks:
```typescript
if (Thread.isMainThread) {
  completion()
} else {
  DispatchQueue.main.async {
    completion()
  }
}
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Option A: Downgrade SumUp SDK
```bash
npm install sumup-react-native-alpha@0.1.30
```

### Option B: Use Alternative SDK
Consider using community-maintained SumUp wrappers:
- `react-native-sumup`
- `react-native-sum-up`

### Option C: Disable SumUp Temporarily
In `DataService.ts`, set:
```typescript
const USE_SUMUP = false;
```

## iOS Entitlements Required

Ensure these entitlements are set in `CashAppPOS.entitlements`:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.proximity-reader.payment.acceptance</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.developer.payment-pass-provisioning</key>
<true/>
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] No main thread warnings in Xcode console
- [ ] SumUp payments still functional
- [ ] App initializes without errors
- [ ] Payment success/failure handling works
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Works on physical iOS device

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "SumUp service not initialized"
**Solution:** Ensure `SumUpThreadSafeService.initialize()` is called in `App.tsx` before rendering.

### Issue: Payments still failing
**Solution:** Check that `SumUpProvider` wrapper is still active in `App.tsx` and API key is valid.

### Issue: Warnings still appearing
**Solution:** Apply the native patch and rebuild the app completely.
