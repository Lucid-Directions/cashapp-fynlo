### 2. Missing Entitlements & Provisioning Profile
**Errors**: 
- `Provisioning profile doesn't support App Groups and Near Field Communication Tag Reading`
- `Missing entitlements: com.apple.developer.proximity-reader.payment.acceptance`

**Root Cause**: 
- Tap to Pay entitlement requires Apple approval (pending)
- App Groups need proper configuration
- NFC capabilities require special permissions

**Immediate Fix Options**:

#### Option A: Remove Restricted Entitlements (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Switch to development entitlements
cp ios/CashAppPOS/CashAppPOS-Development.entitlements ios/CashAppPOS/CashAppPOS.entitlements
```

#### Option B: Configure App Groups Properly
1. **In Apple Developer Portal**:
   - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
   - Select App Groups
   - Create: `group.com.anonymous.cashapppos.payments`
   - Add to your App ID capabilities

2. **In Xcode**:
   - Select project ‚Üí Target ‚Üí Signing & Capabilities
   - Add App Groups capability
   - Enable the group you created

### 3. Tap to Pay on iPhone Status
**Current Status**: Applied but pending Apple approval

**Next Steps**:
1. Check email for Apple's response
2. Usually takes 2-4 weeks for approval
3. Once approved, you'll receive new provisioning profiles

**Temporary Workaround**: 
Use SumUp SDK fallback (already implemented) until Apple approval

### 4. Swift Standard Libraries Warning
**Error**: `Not running swift-stdlib-tool: ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES`

**Fix**: This is a CocoaPods warning, not critical. To fix:
```bash
cd ios
pod install --repo-update
```

## üîß Quick Development Setup

### For Immediate Testing (Without Tap to Pay):

1. **Accept Apple License Agreement** (critical first step)

2. **Use Development Entitlements**:
```bash
cd /Users/arnauddecube/Documents/Fynlo/cashapp-fynlo/CashApp-iOS/CashAppPOS
cp ios/CashAppPOS/CashAppPOS-Development.entitlements ios/CashAppPOS/CashAppPOS.entitlements
```

3. **Remove App Groups Temporarily**:
   - Open Xcode
   - Select CashAppPOS target
   - Signing & Capabilities tab
   - Remove "App Groups" capability

4. **Build and Test**:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm run clean
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npm run build:ios
```

### Expected Functionality:
- ‚úÖ All app features work except Tap to Pay
- ‚úÖ Service charge sync verification works
- ‚úÖ Payment fallbacks (cash, manual card) work
- ‚ùå SumUp Tap to Pay requires Apple approval

## üìã Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Apple Approval:
- [ ] Accept Program License Agreement
- [ ] Configure basic App Groups

## üéØ Current Priority

**CRITICAL**: Accept Apple Developer Program License Agreement first - this blocks everything else.

**NEXT**: Remove restricted entitlements for development testing while waiting for Apple approvals.

This will allow you to test the service charge sync and all other app features immediately.
