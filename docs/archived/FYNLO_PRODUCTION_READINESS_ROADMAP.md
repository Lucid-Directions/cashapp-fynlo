## Critical Path to Production

### Phase 1: Frontend-Backend Integration (4-6 weeks) ⚡ **CURRENT PRIORITY**

#### 1.1 Frontend-Backend Connectivity 🔌 **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Current State**: Frontend attempts API connection but falls back to mock data
**Note**: Authentication mock system is INTENTIONAL for demo/development switching - do not flag as issue

**Required Actions**:
```typescript
// Current: api.ts points to local IP
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.68.101:8000';

// Required: Environment-based configuration
const API_BASE_URL = __DEV__ 
  ? 'http://localhost:8000'
  : 'https://api.fynlo.com';
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Update API configuration for production URLs
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Add connection status indicators
- [ ] Create offline mode with sync capabilities
- [ ] Update CORS settings for production domains

#### 1.2 Dynamic Menu System 🍽️ **CRITICAL**
**Current State**: Hardcoded Mexican restaurant menu
**Required**: Database-driven multi-restaurant menu management

**Backend Already Has** (verified in restaurants.py):
- Restaurant CRUD endpoints
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- JSONB validation for settings

**Frontend Needs**:
```typescript
// Replace hardcoded menu in POSScreen.tsx
const menuItems = await MenuService.getMenuItems(restaurantId);

// New MenuService implementation
class MenuService {
  async getMenuItems(restaurantId: string) {
    return await api.get(`/restaurants/${restaurantId}/menu`);
  }
  
  async updateMenuItem(itemId: string, data: MenuItem) {
    return await api.put(`/menu/items/${itemId}`, data);
  }
}
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create MenuService for API integration
- [ ] Replace hardcoded menu with dynamic loading
- [ ] Build menu management UI for platform owners
- [ ] Add category and modifier management
- [ ] Implement menu item availability controls

#### 1.3 Platform-Controlled Payment Processing 💳
**Current State**: Payment UI exists but configuration is local
**Required**: Platform owners control payment methods per restaurant

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Move payment configuration to platform settings
- [ ] Create payment method toggle interface
- [ ] Implement SumUp as primary with smart routing
- [ ] Add payment method availability per restaurant
- [ ] Create commission rate management

### Phase 2: Complete DigitalOcean Integration (2-3 weeks)

#### 2.1 Restore Production Database Credentials ⚡ **CRITICAL**
**Current Issue**: DigitalOcean credentials may have been lost in branch migration
**Evidence Found**: 
- Backend is using local SQLite (`DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./fynlo_pos_dev.db"`)
- Previous commit shows complete DigitalOcean setup was done (`e3b704b`)
- Need to restore production database connection strings

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Locate DigitalOcean production credentials from previous work
- [ ] Update backend/.env with production PostgreSQL connection
- [ ] Restore Valkey (Redis) cache configuration
- [ ] Test database connectivity to DigitalOcean
- [ ] Verify data migration was preserved

### Phase 3: Data Migration & Integration (2-3 weeks)

#### 3.1 Verify Data Migration Status
**Current Evidence**: Commit `e3b704b` shows DigitalOcean infrastructure was completed
**Files Found**: 
- `DIGITALOCEAN_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md` - Shows credentials were configured
- `backend_data/` directory with JSON data files
- `simple_backend_server.py` - Backend server implementation

**Investigation Tasks**:
- [ ] Verify if DigitalOcean PostgreSQL is still active
- [ ] Check if data migration was completed in previous work
- [ ] Restore production database credentials if lost
- [ ] Test current data persistence state
- [ ] Confirm multi-tenant data structure

#### 3.2 Real-time Features Integration
- [ ] Connect WebSocket for live order updates
- [ ] Implement kitchen display system
- [ ] Add real-time table status updates
- [ ] Create notification system
- [ ] Implement collaborative cart editing

### Phase 4: Business Logic Completion (3-4 weeks)

#### 4.1 Order Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Complete order lifecycle management
- [ ] Implement kitchen routing logic
- [ ] Add order modification capabilities
- [ ] Create split bill functionality
- [ ] Implement tip processing

#### 4.2 Inventory Management
- [ ] Connect inventory to menu items
- [ ] Implement stock deduction on orders
- [ ] Add low stock alerts
- [ ] Create supplier management
- [ ] Build reorder automation

#### 4.3 Reporting & Analytics
- [ ] Replace mock data with real queries
- [ ] Implement data aggregation jobs
- [ ] Create export functionality
- [ ] Add custom report builder
- [ ] Implement predictive analytics
