# Restaurant POS Mode - Current Status

## What's Been Updated

Since the backend auth verification endpoint is not yet implemented, I've made the app work for restaurant POS usage:

1. **Mock Restaurant User**: When you log in with Supabase, the app will create a mock restaurant user with:
   - Role: `restaurant_owner`
   - Restaurant: Casa Estrella
   - Features: POS, Orders, Inventory, Analytics

2. **Focus on POS Functionality**: You'll be directed to the restaurant interface, not the platform owner dashboard

## Try Logging In Again

1. **Run the app** (Metro should still be running)
2. **Login with**:
   - Email: `sleepyarno@gmail.com`
   - Password: Your Supabase password
3. **You'll be logged in as**: Restaurant owner of Casa Estrella

## What You'll See

After successful login:
- ✅ Restaurant POS interface (not platform dashboard)
- ✅ Access to orders, menu, settings
- ✅ Restaurant-specific features

## Current Architecture

```
Supabase Auth → Mock Backend Response → Restaurant Interface
```

When the backend auth endpoint is ready, it will be:
```
Supabase Auth → Real Backend Verification → Restaurant Interface
```

## Next Steps

The app now works for restaurant POS testing. The backend integration can be completed later when the `/api/v1/auth/verify` endpoint is implemented.

For now, you can:
- Test the POS functionality
- Process orders
- Manage restaurant settings
- Use all restaurant features

The platform owner functionality has been de-prioritized as requested.
