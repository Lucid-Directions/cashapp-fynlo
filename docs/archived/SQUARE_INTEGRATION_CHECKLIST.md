## 📝 Implementation Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions:
- Square positioned as secondary payment method (SumUp remains primary)
- Using official react-native-square-in-app-payments SDK for reliability
- PKCE OAuth flow for secure mobile authentication
- Maintaining same service structure as SumUpService for consistency

### Security Considerations:
- OAuth tokens encrypted in production with AES-256

- Webhook signature verification for payment confirmations
- PCI compliance maintained through Square SDK tokenization

### Performance Optimizations:
- Lazy loading of Square payment screens
