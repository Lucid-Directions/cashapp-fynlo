# Metro Bundler Connection Fix

The Metro bundler connection errors (port 8081) are occurring because React Native's debugging infrastructure is trying to connect to the development server, even though the app is using a pre-built bundle.

## Current Status

The app is correctly configured to use the bundled JavaScript file (`main.jsbundle`) as shown in AppDelegate.swift. The connection refused errors are harmless and don't affect app functionality.

## To Eliminate These Warnings

### Option 1: Disable Remote Debugging (Recommended)
1. In the running app, shake the device
2. Select "Disable Remote JS Debugging" if it's enabled
3. Select "Disable Fast Refresh" if it's enabled

### Option 2: Build for Release
Build the app in Release mode which disables all debugging features:
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace ios/CashAppPOS.xcworkspace -scheme CashAppPOS -configuration Release
```

### Option 3: Disable Dev Support in Code
Add to AppDelegate.swift before creating RCTRootView:
```swift
#if DEBUG
  // Disable dev support for production-like testing
  RCTSetDevEnabled(false)
#endif
```

## Note

These connection errors are cosmetic and don't affect the app's functionality. The app is working correctly with the pre-built bundle. The errors only appear in debug builds and will not occur in release builds submitted to the App Store.
