## 8. Critical Issues Found

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Payment Fees Locally Controlled**
   - Risk: Restaurants could modify their own processing fees
   - Impact: Direct revenue loss
   - Solution: Move to platform control immediately

2. **No Platform Settings Sync**
   - Risk: No way to update platform settings remotely
   - Impact: Cannot change fees or features without app update
   - Solution: Implement platform settings API and sync

3. **Missing Security Settings**
   - Risk: No centralized security policy
   - Impact: Compliance and security vulnerabilities
   - Solution: Implement platform security configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **No Transaction Limits**
   - Risk: Potential for fraud or misuse
   - Impact: Financial exposure
   - Solution: Add platform-controlled limits

2. **Feature Flags Not Synced**
   - Risk: Cannot control feature availability
   - Impact: Unable to manage rollouts
   - Solution: Sync feature flags from backend

3. **No Audit Trail**
   - Risk: Cannot track configuration changes
   - Impact: Compliance issues
   - Solution: Implement configuration audit logging

## 9. Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Move payment fee configuration to platform control
2. Implement platform settings sync mechanism
3. Add security configuration framework

### Short-term Actions (Weeks 2-3)

- 100% compliance with platform policies

## Conclusion

The audit reveals that while many settings are correctly placed at the restaurant level, critical revenue and security settings need immediate migration to platform control. The highest priority is moving payment fee configuration to prevent revenue leakage and ensure consistent pricing across the platform.
