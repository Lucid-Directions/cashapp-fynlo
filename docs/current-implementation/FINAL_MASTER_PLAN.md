## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **No Over-Engineering**: Minimal changes for maximum impact
2. **Incremental Adoption**: Start with mobile (most critical)
3. **Clean as You Go**: Remove dead code with every change
4. **Type Safety First**: Shared contracts prevent issues
5. **Backend Authority**: Single source of truth

### Architecture Decision

## 🎯 Final Notes

This plan balances immediate production needs with long-term maintainability. The architecture-first approach ensures fixes are sustainable, while the clean code focus improves developer experience and reduces future technical debt.

Remember:
- Fix it right the first time
- Clean code is faster in the long run
- Architecture enables, not constrains
- Production stability is paramount

**Next Step**: Create Phase 0 Architecture Setup guide and begin implementation.
