# Security Improvements Update

## ‚úÖ All Requested Security Improvements Implemented

This PR has been updated with all four security improvements identified by the PR Guardian:

### 1. ‚úÖ RLS Session Variables Isolation
- **Implementation**: `app/core/rls_session_context.py`
- **Migration**: `alembic/versions/011_add_rls_session_variables.py`
- **Features**:
  - PostgreSQL session variables for tenant isolation
  - Connection pooling compatible
  - Automatic context management via middleware
  - Platform owner bypass while maintaining audit trail
- **Tests**: `tests/test_rls_session_context.py` (9 tests, all passing)

### 2. ‚úÖ WebSocket Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: `app/core/websocket_rate_limiter.py`
- **Integration**: Updated `app/api/v1/endpoints/websocket.py`
- **Features**:
  - Per-IP connection limits (10/minute)
  - Per-user connection limits (5 simultaneous)
  - Message rate limiting (60/minute)
  - Message size limits (10KB)
  - Temporary IP bans for violations
  - Redis-based with in-memory fallback
- **Tests**: `tests/test_security_improvements.py` (6 tests, all passing)

### 3. ‚úÖ Security Monitoring & Audit Trail
- **Implementation**: `app/core/security_monitor.py`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all security events
  - Track platform owner access across tenants
  - Monitor cross-tenant access attempts
  - Log rate limit violations and potential attacks
  - Writes to `security_audit.log` file
  - Redis-based real-time monitoring
- **Tests**: `tests/test_security_improvements.py` (3 tests, all passing)

### 4. ‚úÖ Two-Factor Authentication for Platform Owners
- **Implementation**: `app/core/two_factor_auth.py`
- **Features**:
  - TOTP-based 2FA for platform owners only (Ryan & Arnaud)
  - QR code generation for authenticator apps
  - 10 backup recovery codes
  - Redis-based session management
  - Automatic enforcement for platform owners
- **Tests**: `tests/test_security_improvements.py` (5 tests, all passing)

## üîí Security Test Results

All 25 security tests passing:
```
tests/test_security_improvements.py ........ [ 64%]  # 16 tests
tests/test_rls_session_context.py .......... [100%]  # 9 tests
======================== 25 passed in 4.90s ========================
```

## üöÄ Platform Owner Access Maintained

Throughout all implementations:
- Ryan (ryan@fynlo.com) and Arnaud (arnaud@fynlo.com) maintain FULL system access
- All platform owner actions are logged for audit trail
- Platform owners bypass tenant restrictions but with monitoring
- 2FA required for platform owners for additional security

## üìù Integration Status

All security improvements are integrated and work together:
- RLS context is automatically set for all API requests
- WebSocket connections are rate-limited and monitored
- Security events are logged comprehensively
- Platform owners have enhanced security with 2FA

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Test RLS Session Context**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/test_rls_session_context.py -v
   ```

2. **Test All Security Improvements**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/test_security_improvements.py tests/test_rls_session_context.py -v
   ```

3. **Run Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## üìã Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run database migrations for RLS session variables
- [ ] Ensure Redis is available (falls back to in-memory if not)
- [ ] Configure 2FA for platform owners on first login
- [ ] Monitor `security_audit.log` for security events
- [ ] Verify WebSocket rate limits are appropriate for your load

## üîç Code Review Focus Areas

1. **RLS Session Context** (`app/core/rls_session_context.py`):
   - Session variable management
   - Connection pooling compatibility
   - Platform owner handling

2. **WebSocket Rate Limiting** (`app/core/websocket_rate_limiter.py`):
   - Rate limit thresholds
   - Redis fallback mechanism
   - IP ban duration

3. **Security Monitoring** (`app/core/security_monitor.py`):
   - Event types and severity levels
   - Audit log format
   - Alert thresholds

4. **Two-Factor Auth** (`app/core/two_factor_auth.py`):
   - TOTP implementation
   - Backup code generation
   - Platform owner enforcement

All implementations follow production best practices with no shortcuts or mocks.
