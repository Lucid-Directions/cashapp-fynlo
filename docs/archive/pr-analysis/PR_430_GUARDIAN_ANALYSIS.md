## 🐛 Issue Analysis

### Root Cause Identified:
1. **SlowAPI Middleware Dependency** ✅ FIXED
   - SlowAPI middleware expects `app.state.limiter`
   - `init_fastapi_limiter()` was not setting this
   - Caused AttributeError on all requests

### Fix Implementation:
```python
# After rate limiter initialization
from app.middleware.rate_limit_middleware import limiter
app.state.limiter = limiter
logger.info("✅ SlowAPI limiter attached to app.state")
```

## 🚨 Guardian-Specific Findings

### 1. **Import Location** ✅
**Severity:** None  
**Location:** `main.py` line 76  
**Issue:** Import inside function
**Analysis:** Appropriate - avoids circular imports
**Status:** Correct implementation

### 2. **Error Recovery** ✅
**Severity:** None  
**Location:** Within lifespan try/except  
**Issue:** None - properly handled
**Status:** Will log error if initialization fails

### 3. **Middleware Order** ✅
**Severity:** None  
**Location:** Line 161  
**Issue:** None - correct middleware order
**Status:** SlowAPI added after other middleware

---

## ✅ Change Analysis

### Files Modified:
- `backend/app/main.py` - 4 lines added

### Changes:
1. Import limiter from rate_limit_middleware
2. Set app.state.limiter = limiter
3. Add success log message

### Impact:
- **Positive:** Fixes Internal Server Error
- **Negative:** None
- **Performance:** Negligible (one-time startup)

## 📝 Post-Merge Monitoring

1. Check deployment logs for "✅ SlowAPI limiter attached to app.state"
2. Verify API endpoints return data (not Internal Server Error)
3. Test rate limiting still works
4. Monitor for any new AttributeErrors

## 🔍 Technical Details

**Problem:** SlowAPI middleware initialized at line 161 but `app.state.limiter` was never set  
**Solution:** Set `app.state.limiter` after rate limiter initialization in lifespan  
**Verification:** Deploy and check if API works without errors
