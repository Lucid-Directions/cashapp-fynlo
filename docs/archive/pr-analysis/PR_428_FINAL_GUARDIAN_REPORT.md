- Public endpoints limited to basic health checks only

### 4. **Token Security** ✅ VERIFIED
- No plain text DO_API_TOKEN fallback
- Only encrypted tokens accepted
- Proper error handling for missing tokens

### 5. **Redis Resilience** ✅ VERIFIED
- Graceful fallback to mock Redis
- No data loss on Redis failure
- Proper error logging without exposure

### 6. **Multi-Tenant Isolation** ✅ VERIFIED
- TenantIsolationMiddleware enforced
- Platform owner access properly controlled
- No cross-tenant data leakage

### 7. **Input Validation** ✅ VERIFIED
- Comprehensive InputValidator implementation
- Context-aware sanitization (SQL, HTML, Shell, Path)
- UUID and pattern validation

### 8. **Authentication Flow** ✅ VERIFIED
- No authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- WebSocket properly validates tokens
- Role-based access control enforced

## 🐛 Bug Bot Analysis Results

### Previously Identified Issues - All Resolved:
1. **Predictable Instance IDs** → Fixed with random suffix
2. **Unauthenticated Health Endpoints** → Fixed with auth requirements
3. **Plain Text Token Fallback** → Fixed, encrypted only
4. **Circuit Breaker Version** → Fixed with pybreaker 1.4.0
