# Fynlo Test Infrastructure Improvements (PR #543)

## Summary
Fixed critical bugs identified by cursor bot and established comprehensive test infrastructure from 0% to 66% pass rate (291/443 tests passing).

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. SplitBillService.splitEvenly (✅ FIXED)
- **Issue**: Was assigning full item quantity to each group instead of splitting
- **Fix**: Changed from `createSplitItem(item, item.quantity, 1)` to `createSplitItem(item, 1, groups.length)`
- **Result**: Items now properly distributed among groups in round-robin fashion

### 2. splitBillHelpers Tip Display (✅ FIXED)  
- **Issue**: Showing tip info when tipPercent > 0 even if tip amount was 0
- **Fix**: Changed condition from `group.tipPercent > 0` to `total.tip > 0`
- **Result**: Tip only displays when actual tip amount exists

### 3. modificationHelpers Negative Price Display (✅ FIXED)
- **Issue**: Negative prices (discounts) showed as positive (e.g., -$0.50 appeared as $0.50)
- **Fix**: Properly format negative prices with minus sign
- **Result**: Clear distinction between charges (+$X.XX) and discounts (-$X.XX)

## Test Infrastructure Progress

### Initial State
- 0% test coverage
- No working test infrastructure
- Compilation errors preventing tests from running

### Milestone 1 
- Fixed Jest/Babel TypeScript configuration
- 261/344 tests passing (76% pass rate)

### Current State (After Bug Fixes)
- 291/443 tests passing (66% pass rate)
- Note: Percentage decreased because fixing syntax errors discovered 99 more tests
- Net improvement: +30 more passing tests

## Key Infrastructure Improvements

### 1. Jest/Babel Configuration
```javascript
// jest.unit.config.js
transform: {
  '^.+\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$': 'babel-jest',
},
```

### 2. Test Setup Enhancements
- Fixed "EOF < /dev/null" syntax errors in multiple test files
- Added comprehensive React Native mocks
- Created global logger and theme mocks
- Enhanced AsyncStorage and NetInfo mocks

### 3. Store Mocking Infrastructure
```javascript
// __mocks__/storeMocks.js
export const mockAppStore = {
  cart: [],
  addToCart: jest.fn(),
  removeFromCart: jest.fn(),
  updateCartItem: jest.fn(),
  clearCart: jest.fn(),
  cartTotal: 0,
  cartItemCount: 0,
  // ... other store properties
};
```

### 4. WebSocket Event Polyfills
- Added CloseEvent, MessageEvent, and Event polyfills
- Fixed "CloseEvent is not defined" errors in WebSocket tests

### 5. Test Utilities Created
- `renderWithProviders.tsx` - Consistent component test setup
- `fix-all-tests-fast.sh` - Bulk test fixing script
- `fix-store-mocking.sh` - Store mock configuration

## Files Modified

### Bug Fixes
- `src/services/SplitBillService.ts`
- `src/utils/splitBillHelpers.ts` 
- `src/utils/modificationHelpers.ts`

### Test Infrastructure
- `jest.unit.config.js`
- `__tests__/testSetup.ts`
- `__mocks__/storeMocks.js`
- `__mocks__/websocket-events.js`
- Multiple test files (removed EOF syntax errors)

### New Scripts
- `scripts/fix-all-tests-fast.sh`
- `scripts/fix-remaining-tests.sh`
- `scripts/fix-store-mocking.sh`

## Remaining Work

### Failing Tests (152 remaining)
- Component tests needing proper provider setup
- WebSocket reconnection tests with NetInfo issues
- DatabaseService async handling
- Performance tests with timing issues

### Coverage Goals
- Write tests for AuthContext (security critical)
- Write tests for Payment services (revenue critical)
- Achieve 50% coverage for critical paths

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining 152 failing tests to reach 100% pass rate
2. Write new tests for critical untested components
3. Set up continuous integration to maintain test quality
4. Document testing best practices for team

## Commands

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode
npm run test:failed        # Only failed tests
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage report
```

### Fix Common Issues
```bash
# Fix Dimensions.get() errors
./scripts/fix-all-tests-fast.sh

# Fix store mocking
./scripts/fix-store-mocking.sh
```

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Removed duplicate mock definitions
- Centralized store mocking configuration
- Fixed systematic issues with bulk scripts
- Established patterns for future test development
