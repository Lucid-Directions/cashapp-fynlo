# PR #467 Remaining Work

## Summary of Completed Work
This PR (`fix/eslint-import-order-v2`) successfully applied:
- ✅ 299 out of 332 non-conflicting files from the original PR #467
- ✅ ESLint auto-fixes to 90 additional files
- ✅ Python syntax check workflow
- ✅ Various configuration and documentation updates

## Current ESLint Status
- **Errors**: 124 (significantly reduced)
- **Warnings**: 1,515 (including 167 console.log statements)

## Remaining Conflicts (153 files)
The following categories of files still have merge conflicts with main:

### High Priority (52 files)
- **Screens**: 52 files in `/screens/` directory need manual conflict resolution
- These are user-facing components that need careful handling

### Medium Priority (50 files)
- **Services**: 29 files (auth, websocket, payment services)
- **Components**: 21 files (UI components with logger conflicts)

### Lower Priority (51 files)
- **Tests**: 15 files (can be updated separately)
- **Utils**: 17 files (mostly logger conversions)
- **Store**: 3 files (state management)
- **Other**: 16 files (config, types, etc.)

## Recommended Approach for Future PR
1. **Create focused PRs** for each category rather than one large PR
2. **Start with services** as they're core functionality
3. **Use the logger utility** already created in `src/utils/logger.ts`
4. **Run tests** after each batch of changes

## Common Conflict Patterns
1. **Console.log vs Logger**: Main uses console, PR uses logger utility
2. **Import order**: Different ESLint rules between branches
3. **Type annotations**: `any` vs `unknown` types
4. **Unused variables**: Different naming conventions (`_var` vs `var`)

## Next Steps
1. Merge this PR to capture the 299 successfully applied files
2. Create separate PRs for:
   - Services layer (auth, websocket, payments)
   - Screen components
   - Remaining utilities and tests
3. Consider using automated tools for logger conversion
