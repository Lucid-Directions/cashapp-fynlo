# SumUp Security Fix - Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Backend Implementation**
   - Created secure endpoint `/api/v1/sumup/initialize`
   - Moved API key to environment variable
   - Added authentication and tenant isolation
   - Created comprehensive documentation

2. **Mobile App Updates**
   - Removed all hardcoded API keys
   - Created SumUpConfigService to fetch from backend
   - Updated all payment components
   - Successfully built iOS bundle

3. **Security Improvements**
   - API key never exposed to client

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment (DigitalOcean)

**Environment Variables to Set:**
```bash
SUMUP_API_KEY=<YOUR_SUMUP_API_KEY_HERE>  # Get this from SumUp dashboard
SUMUP_ENVIRONMENT=production
SUMUP_APP_ID=com.anonymous.cashapppos
SUMUP_MERCHANT_CODE=<YOUR_MERCHANT_CODE>  # Get this from SumUp dashboard
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps)
2. Navigate to your Fynlo POS app
3. Click **Settings** â†’ **App-Level Environment Variables**
4. Add the above variables as type `SECRET`
5. Click **Save** - this will trigger a redeployment

### 2. Mobile App Deployment (iOS)

**Build Steps:**
1. Open Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ryandavidson/Desktop/cashapp-fynlo-main/CashApp-iOS/CashAppPOS
   open ios/CashAppPOS.xcworkspace
   ```

2. In Xcode:
   - Select your Apple Developer Team
   - Change bundle version/build number
   - Select "Any iOS Device" as target
   - Product â†’ Archive

3. Upload to TestFlight:
   - Window â†’ Organizer
   - Select the archive
   - Distribute App â†’ App Store Connect
   - Upload

### 3. Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend endpoint returns configuration (test with curl/Postman)
- [ ] Mobile app can fetch configuration
- [ ] SumUp payments work in test mode
- [ ] No API keys visible in mobile app bundle
- [ ] Error handling works when backend is unavailable

### 4. Production Verification

After deployment:
1. Check backend logs for any errors
2. Test payment flow with a real device
3. Monitor for any authentication issues
4. Verify SumUp merchant code is correct

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Merchant Code**: You MUST set the `SUMUP_MERCHANT_CODE` environment variable in production
2. **API Key Security**: The API key in .env file should NEVER be committed to git
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test payment flows before releasing to production
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for any 401/403 errors indicating auth issues

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Backend: Revert to previous deployment in DigitalOcean
2. Mobile: Keep previous version available in TestFlight
3. Can temporarily use old mobile app version while fixing issues
