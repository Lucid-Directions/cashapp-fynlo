## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Existing Infrastructure
The following files already exist from previous work:
- `src/services/ModificationPricingService.ts` (328 lines)
- `src/hooks/useItemModifications.ts` (241 lines)
- `src/components/cart/ItemModificationModal.tsx` (480 lines)
- `src/utils/modificationHelpers.ts`
- Test files for all components

### Key Findings
1. Modification system partially implemented but not connected
2. Enhanced cart store supports modifications
3. Backend has `modifiers` JSONB field on products
4. UI components exist but need integration
