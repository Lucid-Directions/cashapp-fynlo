## Contribution Guidelines

When adding new screen analysis:
1. Use the next sequential number (e.g., 09_)
2. Follow the established structure template
3. Include code references with line numbers
4. Provide severity ratings for issues (High/Medium/Low)
5. Update this index file

## Quick Reference

### Critical Issues Across Screens
- **Orders Screen**: Hardcoded order items in details modal
- **Order Details**: Mock data instead of API integration
- *(More to be added as analyses are completed)*

### Common Patterns
- Theme integration using `useTheme` hook
- DataService for API communications
- Feature flags for progressive rollout
- Modal-based detail views

### Performance Benchmarks
- Target initial load: < 2 seconds
- Smooth scrolling: 60 FPS
- Memory usage: < 150MB
- API response time: < 500ms
